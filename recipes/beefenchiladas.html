    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These enchiladas are absolutely amazing! Truly a recipe your family will love.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>quarter medium onion</li>
        <li>cup cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>dried parsley</li>
        <li>enchiladas sauce</li>
    </ul>



    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li> <br>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef with onion in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain grease. Stir 1 cup Cheddar cheese, sour cream, parsley, taco seasoning, oregano, and black pepper into the ground beef until cheese has melted. Mix in enchilada sauce, chili powder, garlic, and salt; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.</li> <br>
        <li>Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and spoon about 1/4 cup of meat sauce down the center of the tortilla. Top meat sauce with 1 tablespoon black beans and a sprinkling of black olives. Roll the tortilla up, enclosing the filling, and lay seam-side down into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Spoon any remaining meat sauce over the enchiladas and scatter any remaining black beans and black olives over the top. Sprinkle tortillas with 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese.

        </li> </br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese topping is melted and enchiladas and sauce are bubbling, 20 to 22 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
